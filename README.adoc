== Generate documents

=== Html5

generate html5 with external css (to modify it :)

`asciidoctor -a linkcss .\README.adoc` will give a html5 document named link:README.html[`README.html`^]
   
use the `-b xhtml5` argument to produce xml compliant html5  
   
=== Pdf

`asciidoctor-pdf .\README.adoc` will give a pdf document named link:README.pdf[`README.pdf`^]

== Issues

* asciidoctor-pdf indents Admonitions too far - compared to html5

IMPORTANT: too far to the right...

* firefox plugin is not complete.

* pdf fonts are limited eg. `UTF-8 snowman` -> [â˜ƒ] will not be rendered
